# Introduction

This is a homework of math course, requiring for five approaches generating permutation: dictionary, Cantor expansion and vice versa, neighborhood switch, and one new approach different from above all!

There are three basic class: `rank_clas`, store the rank of the permutation, `mid_num_in` and `mid_num_de`, providing supporting for converting from rank to permutation orders, namely middle number.
`mid_num_in` is cantor expansion of variable `rank`, and `mid_num_de` is reversed cantor expansion of variable `rank`.

There are four class: `per_dict`, `per_cantor`, `per_vcantor`, `per_switch`
