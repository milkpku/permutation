# Introduction

This is a homework of math course, requiring for five approaches generating permutation: dictionary, Cantor expansion and vice versa, neighborhood switch, and one new approach different from above all!

There are two basic class: `mid_num_in` and `mid_num_de`, providing supporting for converting from number to permutation strings.

There are four class: `per_dict`, `per_cantor`, `per_vcantor`, `per_switch`
